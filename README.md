# ToDo-List-App
# Personal Task manager 
 In this app, users can create to-do lists, where they can add list of Tasks. The Task created by user then should be stored in the Database.
Under each list, you can add "Cards," which are items in a list. You can add a due date with category, a checklist and labels to each card.
